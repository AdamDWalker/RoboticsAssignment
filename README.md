# RoboticsAssignment

Note: Apparently some people are reading this for their assignment, I don't care but you should know this doesn't navigate properly so it won't help you much

This is the code for the CMP3103M Autonomous Mobile Robotics module assignment at the University of Lincoln. 

The object of the assignment is to program a turtlebot using a ROS environment to autonomously navigate an area and find 4 different coloured objects.


Minor Note: There was only 1 contributor for this project, the commits by a second contributor was a git config mistake.
